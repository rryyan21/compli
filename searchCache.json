    "process": "Direct onsite because I interviewed in the past and did well that time. From the time I sent my resume to interview day: 2 weeks. From interview day to offer over the phone: 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nThe syllabus for the interviews is very clear and simple:\r\n1) Dynamic Programming\r\n2) Super recursion (permutation, combination,...2^n, m^n, n!...etc. type of program. (NP hard, NP programs)\r\n3) Probability related programs\r\n4) Graphs: BFS/DFS are usually enough\r\n5) All basic data structures from Arrays/Lists to circular queues, BSTs, Hash tables, B-Trees, and Red-Black trees, and all basic algorithms like sorting, binary search, median,...\r\n6) Problem solving ability at a level similar to TopCoder Division 1, 250 points. If you can consistently solve these, then you are almost sure to get in with 2-weeks brush up.\r\n7) Review all old interview questions in Glassdoor to get a feel. If you can solve 95% of them at home (including coding them up quickly and testing them out in a debugger + editor setup), you are in good shape.\r\n8) Practice coding--write often and write a lot. If you can think of a solution, you should be able to code it easily...without much thought.\r\n9) Very good to have for design interview: distributed systems knowledge and practical experience. \r\n10) Good understanding of basic discrete math, computer architecture, basic math.\r\n11) Coursera courses and assignments give a lot of what you need to know.\r\n12) Note that all the above except the first 2 are useful in \"real life\" programming too! \r\n\r\nInterview 1:\r\nGraph related question and super recursion\r\n\r\nInterview 2:\r\nDesign discussion involving a distributed system with writes/reads going on at different sites in parallel.\r\n\r\nInterview 3:\r\nArray and Tree related questions\r\n\r\nInterview 4:\r\nDesigning a simple class to do something. Not hard, but not easy either. You need to know basic data structures very well to consider different designs and trade-offs.\r\n\r\nInterview 5:\r\nDynamic programming, \r\nComputer architecture and low level perf. enhancement question which requires knowledge of Trees, binary search, etc.\r\n\r\nAt the end, I wasn't tired and rather enjoyed the discussions. I think the key was long term preparation and time spent doing topcoder for several years (on and off as I enjoy solving the problems). \r\n\r\nConclusion: \"It's not the best who win the race; it's the best prepared who win it.\"",

    "process": "I will split this review into 2 sections pertaining to my preparation process and interview process.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION:\r\nFirst, I prepared by reaching out to my OCM (Office of Career Management) part of my MBA program. They reached out to the alumni that worked in the specific job and connected me with them. This was essential to my process and helped me a lot as it helped me get an inside look of the interviewers thought process before the interview.\r\nI then prepared a document to save and answer any interview question that I could find from resources, such as Glass Door, pertaining to typical Amazon behavioral interview questions.\r\nI also watched interview related YouTube videos that helped me prepare. Since Amazon is such a large company and hires a lot of people, there are a lot of these videos available. There are a few YouTube channels dedicated to the Amazon hiring process and interview preparation.\r\nI then reviewed the leadership principles and familiarized myself with them.  I paired behavioral questions with these principles, and related them to my experience via the STAR format.\r\nOne thing I HIGHLY suggest is practicing your responses, making them fluid and natural as part of a normal conversation. Record yourself, practice in the mirror, etc. Also, do NOT simply write down your responses and read them to the interviewer. This will get you negative points, and possibly cause them to pass on you.\r\n\r\nINTERVIEW:\r\nTotal time: 3 HR, 15 Min. \r\n4 interview, 45 min long, 15 min. break after 2nd interview.\r\nAmazon is moving towards online interview process. There are not doing as much on-campus interviews or flying candidates out to the location for in-person interviews.\r\nMy Amazon interview was a total of FOUR interviews. Each of these interviews lasted for 45 minutes. Amazon will try to do all 4 of these interviews within 1 day. \r\nBe prepared to commit to the interview date, and be prepared for it to take the better half of the day.\r\nEach interviewer was punctual and direct. They gave a quick introduction of themselves, asked for a quick introduction of myself, and then quickly moved into behavioral type questioning.\r\nPreparing ahead of time is essential. I HIGHLY recommend the STAR format. Amazon is very results driven. Don't focus on non-essential information. Focus on actions and results.\r\nEach interviewer will ask you for more details and challenge you during the interview. Be prepared to be challenged and have those answers ready if possible.\r\n2 of the interviewers I had gave me hypothetical questions to get to know my thought process better and to learn what my managerial style is like.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it was a great experience. If you make it to this round of interview, you will most likely do well. Amazon is selective in their candidates, and seek out very qualified individuals for positions like this. You will more than likely enjoy this interview. My preparation helped me a great deal. Do not take the preparation lightly. \r\n\r\nFinally, the questions that I included were part of my preparation and found online. They were also asked by the interviewer. Not all of the questions asked are included.",

      "Round 1 - Online Coding Round : There were 2 coding question and I was able to solve both of them.\n1st question was related to heap and other BFS. Both were Medium level questions.\n\nGot an email from the recruiter next day(16th Feb, 2021) that they will schedule four interview rounds and they will call me soon to discuss.\nThey had given me 1 month of preparation time and scheduled interview on end of March. I don't know they give this much amount of time for\npreparation to others or not.\n\nThe 3 sections of the assessment\n\nCoding challenge (2 scenarios) and Coding approach (elaborate why you code the way you do) - 105 minutes\nWork style survey - 15 minutes\nFeedback survey - 5 minutes\n\nRound 2 - Coding Round with SDE2 (10:00 AM):\nInterview started with the introduction of the interviewer and then he asked me to tell about myself. (~6 mins)\nThen some basic OS question : Process and thread. Difference between them and how they work. (~5 mins)\nCoding Question : No. of Islands. This is standard leetcode question asked by Amazon. (~ 20 mins)\nI already solved this question earlier so I knew the approach as well. I started with a brute force solution and then moved to the optimized approach.\nI was asked to write the optimized solution in production level code and asked me assume the best cases as well.\nAtlast I was asked to dry run the code and explain the code line by line and write the time complexity and space complexity.\nInterviewer was okay with my solution.\n\nNext question was related to string and had to find longest substring of size K. I gave the brute force solution but was not able to come up with the optimized\nsolution. (~15 mins)\nHe told me to write the brute force solution and do the code walk through. In the end he told me that I was missing one base case in my solution.\nI tried to find that missing test case but I was not able to find it. (I think this is the reason I was rejected).\nIn the next ~5-6 mins he asked me some LP's and I was able to answer them based on my experience.\n\nRound 3 - Coding Round with SDE2 (11:30 AM):\n2 Coding questions:\n\nFind the longest substring without repetiting character (https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)\n\nKth Largest Element in an Array (https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/submissions/)\nAble to solve both questions and interviewer was satisfied.\n\nIn the end I was asked 2 LP. I really felt good after this round as I was able to answer all the questions.\n\nI thought I am done for today but around 2:00 Pm I got a call from the recruiter that he is scheduling a managerial coding round at 3:00 PM.\nI told him that I will be available for the round.\n\nRound 4 - Managerial coding round with 2 SDM's\nQuick intro about the Managers and my intro. (~7-8 mins)\n2 LPs (~6-7mins)\nSo far so good.\nCoding Question :\n\nWord Search https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/ (~ 20 mins)\nAble to solve and explain the approach to the interviewer.\nWrote the time complexity and space complexity as well in the end)\nAround 15 mins left.\n\nCalculate the angle between hour hand and minute hand\nI told him my approach but was not able to come up with the correct answer. He mentioned I am going in the right direction and told me to write the\ncode for my approach. As I had not came up with the correct logic I was not able to think how to code it. I wrote pseudocode and explained it.\n(This can be reason for my rejection)\nIn the end they asked me if I had any question.\nAll the interviewers were very friendly and guided me whenever I stucked.\n\nNext day I got a rejection mail. I didn't thought that I will be rejected. I was able to solve almost all coding questions. I prepared all the LP's\nbased on my experience and was confident in all interviews.\n\nI have written the reasons that may led my rejection. Hopefully this will help other candidates while preparing. I wish you luck.",
